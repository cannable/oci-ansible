# Beware

This is very much a work-in-progress, and is likely going to be broken for some time (until I work out the details). This warning will be removed once said details are sorted.

# What is This?

Ansible in a container.

# But... Why?

Because it's there.

The real answer is to contain ansible within a bubble to create a predictable execution environment.

# What is This, Seriously?

* Ansible core and base
* A number of additional Python modules to light up various Ansible modules:
  * Pyvmomi (for vSphere API fun)
  * omsdk (for Dell iDrac fun)
  * hvac (for Hashicorp Vault fun)

What made the cut is entirely based on my personal needs. Adding things to this list is no big.

# Invocation

Coming soon.
